# Career Mentor Agent

## ðŸ§  Overview

The **Career Mentor Agent** is a multi-agent AI system that helps learners explore career paths, discover the skills they need, and identify real-world job roles. It orchestrates three specialist agents to create a smooth, contextual career exploration experience:

- **CareerAgent** â€“ suggests relevant career fields based on user interests.
- **SkillsAgent** â€“ generates a step-by-step skill roadmap for a chosen career.
- **JobAgent** â€“ lists real-world job titles, requirements, and tips for standing out.
- **Career Mentor (Orchestrator)** â€“ guides the flow, asks clarifying questions, and hands off between specialists.

This is built using the OpenAI Agents SDK (or a compatible backend like Gemini via the OpenAI-compatible bridge) and simple function tools for structured decision support.
