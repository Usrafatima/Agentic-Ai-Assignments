# AI Travel Mentor Agent

## ðŸ§  Overview

The **AI Travel Mentor Agent** is a multi-agent system that helps users plan trips end-to-end. It combines destination discovery, booking simulation, and local exploration through specialist agents:

- **DestinationAgent** â€“ recommends destinations based on user preferences.  
- **BookingAgent** â€“ gathers trip details and simulates flight/hotel bookings.  
- **ExploreAgent** â€“ suggests attractions, food, and insider tips for a chosen destination.  
- **Travel Mentor Agent (Orchestrator)** â€“ guides the conversation, routes between specialists, and explains handoffs.

The system is built on top of the OpenAI Agents SDK (or a compatible backend like Gemini via the OpenAI-compatible bridge) with simple function tools providing structured data.
